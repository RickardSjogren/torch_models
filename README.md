# Deep Learning code

## Regression and classification using Pytorch fully connected neural networks (`torch_FullyConnected`)
- Jupyter notebook

(Adapted from my solutions to homework problems for ENM531: Data Driven Modelling at Penn Engineering)

## Pytorch implementation of physics-informed neural network to solve PDE (`torch_PINN`)
Instructions:
- Run: `python pinn_train.py <args>`
- For help with args: `python pinn_train.py --help`
- Edit `pinn_plot_error.py` and run to plot comparison of L2-norm error from true solution for different training set sizes

## Pytorch implementation of CNN to classify cell images (`torch_CNN_cell_images`)
Instructions:
- Run: `python create_datasets.py`
- Run: `python cnn_train.py <args>`
- Run: `python cnn_plots.py <args>`
- For help with args, use flag `--help`
